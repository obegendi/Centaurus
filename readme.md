## What is Centaurus Project?
This is just a experimental project for real world problems. Mainly writing in .Net Core and Nodejs.

The goal of this project is implement the most used technologies and share knowledge about big solutions.

## Why this name?
It makes no sense of course. Just I love everything about space. If someone design a logo based on picture that above, I'll be very happy.
